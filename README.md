# PacMen-Exercise
Create a pacman on demand (button click) and move these pacmen across the page, the goal of this exercise is to learn how to handle adding new items to the DOM and creating movement on the screen.

When you click the “Add PacMan” button, a new pacman should appear at a random position on the screen.
When you click the “Start Game” button, the pacman or pacmen created should start moving at random velocity on the screen.
When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.

* open the index.html in your web broswer to get this game started.
* Roadmap of future improvements: use a GIF to make motion of PacMen more smooth.
